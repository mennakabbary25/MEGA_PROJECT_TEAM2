Autonomous Drone Mission with Obstacle Avoidance System
 1. Introduction and System Overview

This autonomous drone system implements a complete solution for UAV navigation with real-time obstacle avoidance using DroneKit-Python API. 
The architecture integrates four key modules: Mission Planning for waypoint definition, Obstacle Detection using predictive analytics,
Avoidance for dynamic bypass maneuvers, and Visualization for real-time monitoring. Built on MAVLink protocol and SITL simulation, 
the system provides a robust platform for autonomous navigation in obstacle-rich environments.

2. Mission Configuration and Core Algorithms

The mission follows a rectangular survey pattern with five waypoints at 30-meter altitude, 
covering approximately 300Ã—200 meters. Three cylindrical obstacles (3-5m radius) are strategically placed along the route. 
The system employs Haversine formula for precise distance calculations and predictive detection that forecasts drone position 0.8 seconds ahead using velocity vectors.
When obstacles are detected within safety margins, the system generates lateral bypass waypoints 5 meters perpendicular to the threat vector.

3. Control Logic and Mission Execution
Intelligent mode switching between AUTO and GUIDED modes ensures seamless obstacle avoidance.
During normal operation, the drone follows waypoints in AUTO mode, transitioning to GUIDED mode for bypass maneuvers at 7 m/s before resuming mission progress. 
A 6-second cooldown mechanism prevents oscillation around obstacles. The mission workflow includes SITL initialization, automated takeoff, 
continuous 5Hz obstacle monitoring, and Return-to-Launch upon completion.

4. Visualization and Performance

The real-time visualization system displays planned paths, actual trajectories, obstacles, and current position using UTM coordinate transformation.
Performance metrics include 8-11 meter detection ranges, 6 m/s cruise speed, 7 m/s avoidance speed, and 5Hz monitoring frequency. 
Safety features incorporate predictive avoidance, multi-position checking, and conservative safety margins.

5. Conclusion
This system demonstrates reliable autonomous navigation through integrated obstacle avoidance algorithms and dynamic path planning.
The modular architecture supports easy expansion with additional sensors or advanced algorithms, 
providing a foundation for real-world applications in survey and inspection missions where dynamic obstacle avoidance is critical for operational safety and success.
